A full list of Councillors and their contact details are available on the Council’s website www.manordeilosalemcc.org.uk and in Appendix A.</p><p>Meetings are held on the second Wednesday of each month (there is no meeting in August) at 7.30pm at the Manordeilo Reading Room at which members of the public are welcome to attend.</p><p>We are a member of One Voice Wales, the umbrella organisation for town and community councils across Wales, which provides advice and training on matters related to Council business.</p><h3 id="what">What We Do</h3><p>Community Councils act as a voice for their local area, representing the views of local people on matters that affect them. The Manordeilo and Salem Community Council exists to represent the community to the Carmarthenshire County Council and other public bodies, and also to facilitate a range of services and activities that promote the wellbeing of residents.</p><p>Often the point of contact for local people regarding their concerns, we can either address these issues directly where they fall under our statutory powers and competencies, or we can forward them to the correct department within the County Council. We also work closely with our County Councillor who sits on the Community Council.</p><p>Our roles and responsibilities include</p><ul><li>Planning: Community Councils have a statutory right to be consulted on applications for planning permission and the Community Council has a special role, representing a broader, yet still local, view which can be set alongside the comments of those with a more individual interest. Observations are submitted to the Local Planning Authority and these are taken into account in the decision-making process.</li><li>Street Lighting: The Community Council has responsibility for maintaining street lighting and paying the cost of electricity.</li><li>Maintain/purchase benches and notice boards.</li><li>Financial donations: The Community Council receives a large number of requests for financial support during the year and priority is given to charities and organisations based within and bordering the Community Council area or ones that offer services that directly benefit the community. Financial requests are normally considered each February; in exceptional circumstances and where there is a time constraint, applications may be considered at other times.</li></ul><p>During the 2017-18 financial year donations were made to the following organisations:</p><p>Carmarthen and District Youth Opera, The Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal, Gwyl Y Goeden Salem, Y Lloffwr, Cruse Bereavement Care, Urdd Gobaith Cymru Sir Gar, Carmarthenshire Federation of Young Farmer’s Clubs, Macmillan Cancer Support , Cancer Information and Support Services, Llandeilo Young Farmers Club, Cylch Meithrin Ffairfach, Tenovus Cancer Care, Children’s Wales Air Ambulance and Llandeilo and District Sports Association.</p><p>Footpaths: in liaison with the County Council.</p><picture class="full"><source type="image/avif" srcset="images/annual-report/ar4.avif"><img src="images/annual-report/ar4.jpg" alt="Bluebell in a wood"></picture><p>Website, Facebook and Instagram: The Council has set up its own website (www.manordeilosalemcc.org.uk) which provides information about the Council, events, surveys and consultations that affect local people as well as useful links to services. We were also one of the first community councils in Wales to establish Facebook (www.facebook.com/manordeiloandsalemcc) and Instagram (@manordeiloandsalemcc) pages in an attempt to engage with a wider audience and especially the younger generation.</p><p>Provision of defibrillators: Our successful grant application in 2017 enabled us to provide units outside Salem Village Hall, Manordeilo Reading Room, Capel Isaac Vestry and at the rear of The Plough Inn Rhosmaen. In response to a request from the community for an additional unit at Beechwood, we supported a community campaign that included a fund raising event at Salem, donations from local businesses and a contribution from the Community Council itself. This was an excellent example of working in partnership for the general wellbeing of the community. In conjunction with the provision of these units, a series of training sessions have been delivered across the community council area in basic first aid training and defibrillator use, which we will continue to support in the future.</p><p>Engaging with other public bodies/organisations: As a member of One Voice Wales, we are represented on the Mid Wales Area Committee and regularly attend training and consultation events. Through these events we learn best practice ways of working in the sector and contribute to the development of local governance across Wales. We also routinely contribute to the Carmarthenshire Liaison Forum, which includes representatives from town and community councils across the county, as well as councillors and officers from the County Council and One Voice Wales. This is an especially influential forum in contributing to the setting of budget priorities for the County Council. Finally, we are one of just three rural community councils represented on the Key Stakeholder Forum for the Carmarthenshire Local Development Plan, which gives us an important voice within the development planning process.</p><p>Support Salem Village Hall and Manordeilo Reading Room: We have recently supported these valuable community institutions with grant funding for a new kitchen, the purchase of a keyboard and in the running of whist drives and other social events.</p><div class="two-images"><picture class="full"><source type="image/avif" srcset="images/annual-report/ar5.avif"><img src="images/annual-report/ar5.jpg" alt="Salem village Hall"></picture><picture class="full"><source type="image/avif" srcset="images/annual-report/ar6.avif"><img src="images/annual-report/ar6.jpg" alt="Manordeilo reading room"></picture></div><h3 id="funding">Funding</h3>The Council derives most of its funds from its Precept. This is an additional sum that is added to the County Council tax bill based upon the Community Council’s estimated expenditure. The precept figure for the financial year April 2018 to March 2019 is £15,000. The Council’s audited accounts for the financial year ending 31st March 2018 can be found on the Council’s website and in Appendix B.<h3 id="aims">Our Aims</h3><p>We aim to be proactive in consulting and engaging with local residents in order to effectively represent our community. To this end, we have set up our website on which we publish our agendas, minutes and accounts and share information on other social media platforms. We will continue to develop these channels of communication and engagement in an attempt to encourage more awareness of the work of the Council and to encourage greater participation by all age groups within our communities. The production of this report is also a further tool to inform and engage with local people.</p><p>We aim to provide more defibrillators across our community and provide training sessions to local residents on their use.</p><p>We aim to develop the existing positive working partnership with the local authority, neighbouring town and community councils and other agencies for the mutual benefit of our communities.</p><p>We aim to encourage and facilitate more coming together of the communities within our area for the mutual benefit of all.</p><h3 id="appendixa">APPENDIX A</h3><h4>Salem Ward</h4><dl class="cllr-list"><dt>Gwenfyl Evans</dt><dd>Croesnant, Capel Isaac, Llandeilo SA19 7ES</dd><dd>01558 85322</dd><dt>Peter Harries</dt><dd>Crud Yr Awel, Salem, Llandeilo SA19 7LY</dd><dd>01558 823075</dd><dt>Doris Jones</dt><dd>Maesteilo Farm, Capel Isaac, Llandeilo SA19 7TG</dd><dd>01558 68826</dd><dt>Owen Williams</dt><dd>Maesydderwen, 1 Golwg y Gaer, Salem, Llandeilo SA19 7PA</dd><dd>01558 822061</dd></dl><h4>Cwmifor Ward</h4><dl class="cllr-list"><dt>Alun Davies</dt><dd>Trefwri, Rhosmaen, Llandeilo SA19 7AF</dd><dd>01558 823954</dd><dt>Arwel Davies</dt><dd>Erwlon, Manordeilo, Llandeilo, SA19 7BG</dd><dd>01550 777571</dd><dt>Kimberley Davies</dt><dd>Glanrhyd Station House, Manordeilo, Llandeilo, SA19 7BR</dd><dd>01550 777930</dd><dt>Joseph Davies (County Cllr)</dt><dd>5 Ger Y Llan, Cwmifor, Llandeilo SA19 7AW</dd><dd>01558 822167</dd><dt>Hubert Gwynne</dt><dd>Coedmawr, Manordeilo, Llandeilo SA19 7BS</dd><dd>01558 822219</dd><dt>William Loynton</dt><dd>7 Caledfwlch, Cwmifor, Llandeilo SA19 7BT</dd><dd>01558 823627</dd><dt>Andrew Thomas</dt><dd>Nantwgan, Brynwgan Farm, Llandeilo, SA19 7LE</dd><dd>01558 822449</dd></dl><h3 id="appendixb">APPENDIX B</h3> <?php include("accounts/ye2018.php"); ?> <div class="top"><a href="#header">Top</a></div>
