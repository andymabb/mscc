These Wards also include the communities of Capel Isaac, Manordeilo, Penybanc, Rhosmaen and Taliaris. Membership of the Community Council is made up of 12 councillors, seven councillors representing the Cwmifor Ward and five representing the Salem Ward.</p><p>Meetings are normally held on the second Wednesday of every month (there is no meeting in August) at 7:30pm in the Manordeilo Reading Room. During the Covid-19 pandemic, meetings are being held remotely via Zoom and this arrangement will continue until further notice. Members of the community can still access these meetings however and login details are provided on the agendas posted on our website and notice boards in the community.</p><p>The Community Council is mainly funded through a Precept. A Precept is a charge that is included within the Council Tax collected by Carmarthenshire County Council and redistributed to community and town councils. We are also able to apply for grants for special projects.</p><h3>What we do</h3><p>The Council represents the people living in our area at the closest level to the community. We represent the views of our communities and actively engage in matters such as:</p><h4>Community facilities and projects</h4><ul><li>For example: benches, defibrillators, notice boards and financial contributions to local causes and charities.</li></ul><h4>Environment</h4><ul><li>For example: biodiversity and footpath conditions.</li></ul><h4>Highways</h4><ul><li>For example: road conditions and signs, street lighting and traffic issues.</li></ul><h4>Planning applications</h4><ul><li>The Community Council has a statutory right to be consulted on all planning applications in our communities and makes observations to the planning authority that are taken into account in the	decision-making process.</li></ul><p>We also work with Carmarthenshire County Council, other community and town councils and authorities such as the Welsh Government and Dyfed-Powys Police to provide local services. We are a member of One Voice Wales, the umbrella organisation for town and community councils across Wales.</p><p class="r"><a href="#news">Y newyddion diweddaraf</a></p><section class="bb mb5"><h3>Diffibrilwyr</h3><p class="error">Find below a list of locations for defibrillators that the Community Council have funded and/or supported across our community</p><ul><li>All Small Engines, Manordeilo, Llandeilo, SA19 7BG</li><li>Manordeilo Reading Room, Cwmifor, Llandeilo, SA19 7AW</li><li>Salem Village Hall, Salem, Llandeilo, SA19 7LY</li><li>Capel Isaac Vestry, Capel Isaac, Llandeilo, SA19 7TL</li><li>The Plough Inn, Rhosmaen, Llandeilo, SA19 6NP</li><li>Teilo Vets, Beechwood Estate, Talley Road, Llandeilo, SA19 7HR</li></ul></section><section class="bb mb5"><img src="images/audit-notice.png" alt="Audit Notice" class="fr border" width="250" height="319"><h3>Hysbysiad Archwilio ar gyfer y Flwyddyn Ariannol sy'n Diweddu 31 Mawrth 2020</h3><p class="error">Please find below the Notice of Appointment of Date for the Exercise of Elector's Rights under the Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004.</p><p class="error"><a href="downloads/Notice of date appointed for the exercise of_electors.pdf">Dogfen Rhybudd Archwilio</a> <small>(PDF - English)</small></p></section><section class="bb mb5"><h3>Eich Cynghorwyr</h3><details><summary>Gweld cynghorwyr a'u manylion cyswllt</summary> <?php include("single-docs/councillors_cy.php"); ?> </details></section><section class="mb5" id="news"><h3>Y newyddion diweddaraf</h3><p class="error">translation</p><div class="well"><h4>Message from Dyfed Powys Police - Just Hang Up!</h4><p>Criminals pretending to be from Microsoft, Norton and BT are trying to scam Dyfed-Powys residents.</p><p>If you receive a call saying your computer is infected or has serious errors, or your anti-virus needs updating, just hang up the phone.

These were then delivered through the kindness and generosity of Feed The NHS Wales.

We therefore sent along some giant bean bags and deck chairs to help staff in the Physiotherapy Department to help them relax between shifts. We also sent over a supply of scrubs bags because we know how useful these are to help keep things clean.
