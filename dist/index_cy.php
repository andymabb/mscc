These were then delivered through the kindness and generosity of Feed The NHS Wales. The photos below show staff from Merlin and Tysul wards enjoying them during a well-earned break:</p><div class="two-images"><picture class="full"><source type="image/avif" srcset="images/news/hospital-staff1.avif"><img src="images/news/hospital-staff1.jpg" height="768" width="432" alt="Health workers enjoy donated food"></picture><picture class="full"><source type="image/avif" srcset="images/news/hospital-staff2.avif"><img src="images/news/hospital-staff2.jpg" height="768" width="432" alt="Health workers enjoy donated food"></picture></div><p>We also wanted to thank staff elsewhere in the hospital who have been committed to caring for patients across all wards under very difficult circumstances. We therefore sent along some giant bean bags and deck chairs to help staff in the Physiotherapy Department to help them relax between shifts. We also sent over a supply of scrubs bags because we know how useful these are to help keep things clean.
