<h1>Manordeilo & Salem Community Council Online Policy</h1><ol class="with-headings"><li><h2>Introduction</h2><p>This document should be read as a companion to the Online Strategy document for Manordeilo & Salem Community Council (hereafter known as “the Council”) and the Councillors’ Code of Conduct.</p><p>The intention of this document is to set out the operating procedures for establishing, managing and (if necessary) closing online and social media accounts, profiles and platforms in the name of the Council.</p><p>Any changes made to this policy must be through a vote of the full Council.</p></li><li><h2>Establishing a new online presence</h2><p>To establish a new online presence, such as a website, blog, social media account or other such platform, the item must first be placed on the agenda for the following meeting in accordance with the Council Standing Orders.</p><p>At the following meeting a new online presence may be established once the full Council has taken a vote on the matter. However, all Councillors present must be made aware of the primary advantages and disadvantages of such an endeavour, particularly in terms of data and information security.</p></li><li><h2>Registering and setting up accounts</h2><p>As stated in the Online Strategy, the Clerk is to be designated as the ‘Council’ owner of the Community Council website, as well as any online and social media channels agreed by the Community Council. However, Councillors may be officially appointed following a vote by the full Council to assist the Clerk to disseminate information on the Council’s website and social media accounts.</p><p>Whichever of the Clerk or appointed Councillors is designated as the ‘lead’ shall be responsible for accurately and appropriately inputting any information required to establish registration for a new online presence. This information should not exceed the minimum required by the online platform unless it is deemed in the public interest.</p><p>The registration information shall be exclusively the information corresponding to the Council itself. Examples include, but are not limited to; address and contact details. If a responsible individual must be named on behalf of the Council then the name and information of the Clerk must be provided.</p><p>If payment is required to register a new online presence then this must first be agreed to by a vote of the full Council before any aspect of the registration process has begun and must be in accordance with the Standing Orders and Financial Regulations of the Council.</p><p>Any registration must be completed in the name of the Council itself and not in the name of any individual(s) or group(s) of Councillors or any Responsible Officer including the Clerk. Any new online presence must state clearly that it is established and maintained by Manordeilo & Salem Community Council and no other individual(s), group(s) or organisation(s).</p></li><li><h2>Responsibility for managing and maintaining an online presence</h2><p>Responsibility for the day-to-day management and maintenance of the presence of the Council on its online platforms shall be invested in the Clerk as the ‘owner’ of the platforms and the Councillor designated as the ‘lead’ (if different from the Clerk).</p><p>However, the Council may wish to create additional ‘administrators’ who will each be invested with joint responsibility for managing and maintaining the presence of the Council on its online platforms, in addition to the Clerk and the ‘lead’ (if different from the Clerk).</p><p>Additional ‘administrators’ may be appointed by a vote of the full Council. A maximum of two ‘administrators’ may be appointed to manage and maintain the presence of the Council on its online platforms in addition to the Clerk and the ‘lead’. However, if the Clerk is also the ‘lead’, then a maximum of three ‘administrators’ may be appointed by a vote of the full Council.</p><p>The ‘lead’ or any ‘administrators’ may be replaced or have their positions and account access removed and revoked following a vote of the full Council.</p></li><li><h2>Monitoring and scrutiny</h2><p>To allow Councillors the opportunity to scrutinise the management and maintenance of the online presence of the Council a regular agenda item should be created for Online & Social Media Accounts.</p><p>Councillors also have the option to appoint a sub-committee to scrutinise the management and maintenance of the online presence of the Council. The sub-committee may comprise no more than four Councillors and may be appointed by a vote of the full Council. The sub-committee should not include the ‘lead’ or any ‘administrators’.</p></li><li><h2>Absence of the ‘lead’</h2><p>If the ‘lead’ is unable to fulfil their role to manage and maintain the online presence of the Council for a period of no less than three months for any reason then a new ‘lead’ must be appointed by a vote of the full Council.</p><p>An acting ‘lead’ may be appointed in the intervening period to ensure that a Council representative is available at all times to respond to any messages received from members of the community. The acting ‘lead’ may be the Clerk (if different from the original ‘lead’) or an ‘administrator’.</p></li><li><h2>Online Misconduct</h2><p>For the purpose of this policy, online misconduct may be defined as the use of electronic communication to cause offence or inflict harm upon any individual(s), group(s) or organisation(s), to represent the Council in a negative manner or to contravene the Councillors’ Code of Conduct in any way.</p><p>Examples include, but are not limited to; posting or sharing illegal or copyrighted material, posting or sharing abusive, defamatory or offensive comments, images or videos, posting or sharing material that may reasonably be viewed as highly controversial, posting or sharing personal data or information without consent, posting or sharing sensitive Council data or information such as passwords etc.</p><p>Misconduct must be investigated and decided in the same manner as contravention of the Councillors’ Code of Conduct. Penalties for misconduct must also be decided in the same manner as penalties for contravening the Councillors’ Code of Conduct.</p><p></p></li><p></p><li><h2>Guidelines and Parameters for Online Activity</h2><p>The Council should endeavour to afford reasonable freedom for its representative(s) online in accordance with the nature of online platforms. The instantaneous nature of social media often requires immediate comment, feedback or resolution, otherwise the potential for meaningful engagement will be limited.</p><p>To aid the Council and its representatives in navigating the uncertain terrain surrounding social media, and to maintain a positive and professional image of the Council at all times, Councillors and Responsible Officers (including the Clerk) are advised to follow these guidelines:</p><ul><li>Abide by Policies</li><li>All activity on the online platforms that the Council maintains must follow the Council’s agreed aims and outcomes as stated in the Online Strategy and be in accordance with the Councillors’ Code of Conduct and other relevant policies</li><li>Be careful what is posted or shared</li><li>Post only what is acceptable for the world to view.

Posts or shares of any group(s) or organisation(s) should be balanced with posts or shares from other similar groups or organisations where possible</li><li>Posts or shares from individuals should only be accepted if they contain information not available elsewhere and that the information is likely to be relevant or of interest to the community of Manordeilo & Salem</li><li>Posts on the website should only include matters discussed in Council meetings, official notices such as, but not limited to, notices of audit and elections, and information that is mandated by statute such as, but not limited to, contact details for the Council and Councillors and agenda and minutes</li><li>Post frequency</li><li>The online presence of the Council should be updated frequently although this is not always possible</li><li>The website should be updated at least once a month and preferably once a week</li><li>The social media accounts of the Council should be updated at least once a week and be monitored on a daily basis if possible for new comments, messages, likes or shares</li><li>Receipt of comments, messages or posts</li><li>Where comments, messages or posts are received on the social media pages of the Council, an appropriate response should be issued in a timely manner in most cases</li><li>Any questions or issues should be immediately passed on to the Clerk if possible or, if they could reasonably be viewed as simple or require urgent responses, should be addressed by the ‘lead’ or ‘administrators’ in the manner of a simple or urgent question or issue received through any other media form i.e. via telephone, email or in person</li><li>If matters have been passed on to the Clerk, then this should be explicitly stated in a timely reply to the individual, group or organisation that originally raised the matter</li><li>Some comments or posts may not require a response but may be ‘liked’ or ‘shared’. Care must be taken in this regard to avoid the assumption that specific statements or viewpoints are not ‘liked’ or ‘shared’ that may imply agreement or favouritism on the part of the Council without prior authorisation or confirmation of a Council position on the matter</li><li>Any comment(s), message(s) or post(s) received that may reasonably be described as controversial, offensive, illegal, infringing copyright or other such acts not endorsed by the Council and not deemed appropriate should be deleted immediately and reported to the social media platform.

Examples of these include, but are not limited to;calendar programs and games.</p><p>Anti-virus and malware protection should be regularly maintained and updated on any device that is used to access the Council website or social media pages to avoid infections of adware and spyware and the threat of hacking.</p></li><li><h2>Elections</h2><p>No Council website or Council social media page may be established or removed during the period after the Notice of a Community Council Election has been announced until the first normal meeting after the Poll has been concluded.</p><p>No material details or information pertaining to the Council website or Council social media pages may be changed or modified during the period after the Notice of a Community Council Election has been announced until the first normal meeting after the Poll has been concluded.
