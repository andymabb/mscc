<h1>Manordeilo & Salem Community Council Online Strategy</h1>

<ul class="with-headings">
    <li><h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This document is intended to provide the framework to manage the internet and social media presence of the Community Council (hereafter referred to as “the Council”) and to outline the Council’s forward vision on their use.</p>
        <p>In addition, it is intended to provide an overview and explanation of social media for the Clerk and Councillors, including the potential benefits and drawbacks of their use.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h2>Social Media</h2>
        <p>Social media has become the common term to describe a host of websites, applications and other online communication channels that are founded on content that is created, shared and viewed by users. This content may include text, photographs, video and audio that users may interact with to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
        <p>Examples of social media range from all-encompassing social networks such as Facebook or to niche services such as LinkedIn (for businesses and working professionals). Other examples include Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, WhatsApp, Wikipedia and YouTube.</p>
        <p>Worldwide, social media usage expanded by more than 480 million active users in the year between January 2016 and January 2017, with global social media usage now estimated to be around 2.8 billion active users<sup id="fn1"><a href="#footnote1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
        <p>According to the statistical services company Statista<sup id="fn2"><a href="#footnote2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, as of April 2017, Facebook is the most popular social media platform in the world with almost two billion monthly active users (with 42 million in the UK). The same estimates suggest that WhatsApp has around 1.2 billion monthly active users while Twitter has around 320 million.</p>
        <p>In the UK, the Office for National Statistics<sup id="fn3"><a href="#footnote3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> reported in 20163 that at least 63% of adults aged 16 or over had used the internet for social networking during the three months prior to the survey, which represented a 40% increase from 2011. In addition, 91% of 16-24 year-olds had used social networks during the same period, suggesting that overall usage may continue to increase.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Social Media</h2>
        <p>Some of the numerous benefits of social media for Community Councils include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhanced engagement</li>
                <li>Greater scope for Councils and residents to actively engage regularly</li>
                <li>Speed of communication</li>
                <li>Communication of activities, events and issues can be instantaneous</li>
                <li>Breadth of communication</li>
                <li>Ability to form and maintain connections with anyone anywhere</li>
                <li>Potential to engage with both young and older members of the community</li>
                <li>Opportunity to engage with more isolated groups</li>
                <li>Easy accessibility</li>
                <li>Multiple devices can support social media (desktop computers; laptops; smartphones; tablets)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    
    <li>
        <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
        <p>Although the benefits of social media are significant, there are downsides to every communication medium, which in this case include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Privacy of information is limited</li>
            <li>Anything posted or shared will enter the public domain in some form</li>
            <li>Community Councils should be accessible to all so its posts may be viewed by anyone in the world</li>
            <li>Registration is not required to view content in most cases. It is usually only required should one wish to participate on a site</li>
            <li>Monitoring processes can be flawed</li>
            <li>Groups or pages can be edited by administrators to reflect only a single interest</li>
            <li>Robust monitoring of administrative privileges is required to ensure diverse interests and voices are represented fairly</li>
            <li>“Fake news”</li>
            <li>There is no guarantee of truth to statements posted or shared online</li>
            <li>Ill-informed comment and gossip is as likely to be found as useful information</li>
            <li>Any post presenting factual claims without supporting sources available for scrutiny must be approached with caution</li>
            <li>Rapid communication</li>
            <li>The nature of social media as a set of platforms for instant communication can pressurise one to respond too quickly to comments or posts without sufficient time for weighted judgement</li>
            <li>Situations may become unintentionally inflamed and mistaken posts or responses can be spread around the world in moments</li>
            <li>Friends of Friends</li>
            <li>Care must be taken to ensure that all “Friendship requests” on social media are carefully scrutinised and judged on their individual merits</li>
            <li>Friends of friends may occasionally be figures or organisations that a Community Council may not wish to be associated with upon further investigation</li>
            <li>Time</li>
            <li>Viewing and responding to messages takes time. Care must be taken that the benefits do not outweigh the value gained</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h2>Aims and Objectives</h2>
        <p>The Council aims to use the internet and social media in order to improve engagement and interaction, particularly with younger people within the community, and to increase publicity of the functions and work of the Council. </p>
        
        <p>We will achieve these objectives by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Communicating news, information and events from the Council or from other individuals and organisations with links to the community</li>
            <li>Sharing appropriate and relevant content</li>
            <li>Engaging with individuals and organisations in a timely, appropriate and positive manner to promote Council services, resolve issues and generate positive publicity</li>
            <li>Upholding and improving the reputation of the Council</li>
            <li>Adopting a consistent approach and clear vision across all online platforms</li>
            <li>Safeguarding any sensitive Council information and keeping it secure</li>
            <li>Ensuring that users operate within the Code of Conduct and guidelines elsewhere in this policy and other relevant Council documents</li>
            <li>Integrating online communications with each other and with traditional forms of communication such as noticeboards</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h2>Policy Statement</h2>
        <p>It is acknowledged that there is considerable potential for using online platforms, especially social media, which can provide significant advantages. The responsible, corporate use of social media is actively encouraged. The following applies equally to the Clerk and Councillors.</p>
        <p>This policy provides a structured approach to using social media and will ensure that it is effective, lawful and does not compromise Council information.Users must ensure that they use social media sensibly and responsibly, and ensure that its use will not adversely affect the Council or its business, nor be damaging to the Council's reputation and credibility or otherwise violate any Council policies.</p>
        <p>The following guidelines will act in support of the Councillors’ Code of Conduct and further guidelines applicable in the Online & Social Media Policy of the Council. These aforementioned guidelines apply to online participation and set out the standards ofbehaviour expected as a representative of Manordeilo & Salem Community Council:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be aware of and recognise your responsibilities identified in the Internet and Social Media Policy</li>
                <li>Remember that you are personally responsible for the content you publish on any form of social media</li>
                <li>Never give out personal details of others such as home address and telephone numbers</li>
                <li>Ensure that you handle any personal or sensitive information in line with the Data Protection Act</li>
                <li>Use a disclaimer. When using social media for personal purposes, you must not imply you are speaking for the Council. Avoid use of the Council e-mail address, logos or other council identification. Make it clear that what you say is representative of your personal views only. Where possible, you should include a standard disclaimer, such as: "Statements and opinions here are my own and don't necessarily represent the Council's policies or opinions"</li>
                <li>Know your obligations: you must comply with other Council policies when using social media. For example, you should be careful not to breach Council confidentiality and proprietary information policies and the Code of Conduct</li>
                <li>Show respect to all. Derogatory comments are always wrong</li>
                <li>Use of the Council’s website or Facebook accounts must always reflect the Council’s position and decisions on a matter and in no circumstances must it be used to express personal opinion, particularly when used by a Councillor. If unsure, say nothing</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>Councillors are at liberty to set up accounts using any of the tools available but should ensure they are clearly identified as personal and do not in any way imply that they reflect the Council’s view. Councillors should at all times present a professional image and not disclose anything of a confidential nature. Comments of a derogatory, proprietary or libellous nature should not be made and care should be taken to avoid guesswork, exaggeration and colourful language.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>The Clerk is to be designated as the ‘Council’ owner of the Community Council website and any online and social media channels agreed by the Community Council. Councillors may be officially appointed by the Community Council following a vote by the Council to assist the Clerk to disseminate information on the Council’s website and social media accounts.</p>
        <p>It is required that all responsible officers, including the Clerk, and all Councillors representing the Council follow this policy. No account details may be changed without the permission of the Clerk. Individual Councillors are at liberty to set up their own accounts but they should ensure they comply with this policy and with the Code of Conduct of the Community Council. Councillors must also ensure the ‘personal view’ disclaimer is used for individual accounts.</p>
        
        <h2>Guidance for Councillors - social media and meetings</h2>
        <p>The Council encourages Councillors to keep residents informed of Manordeilo & Salem community issues and the use of social media in particular can help with this objective. </p>
        
        <p>Below are some extra guidelines for Councillors to consider for the use of social media during meetings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Handheld devices are permitted for use during meetings to allow environmentally friendly and effective communication. The use of such devices is intended to improve communication during meetings - not to interrupt or distract anyone taking part. Ensure the volume on all electronic devices is turned to 'mute'</li>
            <li>Social media updates from Councillors during Council meetings should refer to the discussions that are taking place at the meeting - updates about other subjects will show the public and other attendees at the meeting that you are not engaging properly in the meeting</li>
            <li>Councillors have a responsibility to take Council business seriously and it is not appropriate for members to use social media to tease or insult other members</li>
            <li>Remember that if you break the law using social media (for example by posting something defamatory), you will be personally responsible</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h2>Facebook Strategy</h2>
        <p>Social media have been rapidly growing in popularity in the UK and around the world for the last ten years. Research suggests<sup id="fn4"><a href="#footnote4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> that in 2016 a majority of people from all age groups up to 65 years old were active users of social networks in the three months prior to being surveyed.</p>
        <p>For individuals, social networking sites provide tremendous opportunities for staying in touch with friends and family, as well as accessing news and information on activities and events. For the Council, these sites provide a modern alternative to communicating with residents of the community, particularly younger people who are often unaware of the functions and role of the Council.</p>
        <p>Facebook is the obvious choice for many Councils and community organisations to begin to establish a social media presence. As already stated, it is by far the largest social network in the world based on monthly active users, as well as being the most popular social network in the UK.</p>
        <p>A survey published by Ofcom in 2016<sup id="fn5"><a href="#footnote5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> suggested that 95% of all adults aged 16 or over in the UK who have a social media profile use Facebook. This equates to almost 60% of the total adult population of the UK. Facebook was considered to be the primary social media platform of 84% of people with social media profiles. The next-highest percentage was the messaging service WhatsApp with just 5%.</p>
        <p>Two of the great advantages of Facebook are the versatility of the platform and the ease with which organisations and individuals can connect and interact. For example, Facebook allows the Council to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Share unlimited content including images and videos</li>
                <li>Share articles / blog posts / expertise</li>
                <li>Start discussions and ask questions to encourage interaction</li>
                <li>Create surveys to encourage participation from residents</li>
                <li>Provide news and events from the area</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>One of the hallmarks of online networks is the ability to “friend” others – creating a group of others that share interests and personal news. Care should be exercised when accepting invitations to friend others within personal social networking sites. Friends will gain access to the Council’s network of contacts on the site.</p>
        <p>Good practice guidelines and operating procedures for the use of online and social media by the Council can be found within the separate Online & Social Media Policy.</p>
    </li>
    
    
    <li>
        <h2>Instagram Strategy</h2>
        <p>Instagram is a photo-sharing social media platform that allows users to upload and share photos and short videos that have been filtered in a range of ways to highlight particular features or points. With over 600 million active monthly users<sup id="fn6"><a href="#footnote6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> the site has become the primary method of sharing photographic stories around the world.</p>
        <p>Within the UK, Instagram announced in 2014<sup id="fn7"><a href="#footnote7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> that it had 14 million registered active monthly users, although it has shown a remarkable doubling in global growth since that time. The percentage of adults with social media profiles in the UK who reported having established profiles on Instagram has also increased significantly(37.5%) since 2014 according to Ofcom<sup id="fn8"><a href="#footnote8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p>
        <p>The advantages of Instagram to Councils are numerous, yet many have been slow to adopt profiles, with only a handful of Community Councils around the UK registering at the time of writing. Some advantages include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Promoting attractive features of the community</li>
                <li>Promoting Council or community activities and events</li>
                <li>Raising awareness of issues</li>
                <li>Encouraging increased user engagement</li>
                <li>Supporting Facebook page through ease of linkage</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h2>Website</h2>
        <p>Despite the ubiquity of social media, traditional websites maintain an important role in the online strategies of public organisations, especially Community Councils.</p>
        <p>The Local Government (Democracy) (Wales) Act 2013 requires Community Councils to have websites and to publish various information electronically. This information includes contact details for the Clerk and Councillors as well as agenda and minutes of Council meetings.</p>
        <p>While social media allows publication of some of this material, publishing significant amounts of documents in a static location remains a task best suited to websites, which are not only available to be viewed by anyone with an internet connection but also perform the role of information repositories.</p>
        <p>The Community Council intends to maintain and regularly update its website until such time as websites are no longer mandatory for Community Councils and a suitable, cost-effective online replacement emerges.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h2>Other Social Media</h2>
        <p>At this stage it is not intended to use any other forms of social media for official use by Manordeilo & Salem Community Council. However, this should be open to review in the future, with regular monitoring expected.</p>
        <p>New online and social media platforms may emerge that become popular among local residents or that provide greater utility in engaging with the community. These should be reviewed and adopted as far as possible to ensure that the Council maintains a progressive approach to technology and community engagement.</p>
        <p>Councillors are entitled to use any form of social media they wish to but must abide by the guidelines outlined in this strategy and the complementary Online & Social Media Policy at all times when so doing.</p>
