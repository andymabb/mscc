	<div class="regs">
		<h2 id="fr-GENERAL">1. GENERAL</h2>
		
		<p>1.1. These financial regulations govern the conduct of financial management by the Council and may only be amended or varied by resolution of the Council. Financial regulations are one of the Council’s three governing policy documents providing procedural guidance for members and officers. Financial regulations must be observed in conjunction with the Council’s standing orders1 and any individual financial regulations relating to contracts. </p>
		<p>1.2. The Council is responsible in law for ensuring that its financial management is adequate and effective and that the Council has a sound system of internal control which facilitates the effective exercise of the Council’s functions, including arrangements for the management of risk.</p> 
		<p>1.3. The Council’s accounting control systems must include measures:</p>
		    <ul>
		    	<li>for the timely production of accounts;</li>
		    	<li>that provide for the safe and efficient safeguarding of public money;</li>
		    	<li>to prevent and detect inaccuracy and fraud; and</li>
		    	<li>identifying the duties of officers.</li>
		    </ul>
		<p>1.4. These financial regulations demonstrate how the Council meets these responsibilities and requirements.</p>
		<p>1.5. At least once a year, prior to approving the Annual Governance Statement, the Council must review the effectiveness of its system of internal control which shall be in accordance with proper practices.</p>
		<p>1.6. Deliberate or wilful breach of these Regulations by an employee may give rise to disciplinary proceedings.</p>
		<p>1.7. Members of Council are expected to follow the instructions within these Regulations and not to entice employees to breach them.

		<p>1.8. The Clerk has been appointed as RFO for this Council and these regulations will apply accordingly.</p>
		<p>1.9. The RFO;</p>

The accounting records determined by the RFO shall be sufficient to show and explain the Council’s transactions and to enable the RFO to ensure that any income and expenditure account and statement of balances, or record of receipts and payments comply with the Accounts and Audit (Wales) Regulations and to prepare additional or management information, as the case may be, to be prepared for the Council from time to time.</p> 
		<p>1.11. The accounting records determined by the RFO shall in particular contain:</p>

		</ul>
		<p>1.12. The accounting control systems determined by the RFO shall include:</p>
		    <ul>
		    	<li>procedures to ensure that the financial transactions of the Council are recorded as soon as reasonably practicable and as accurately and reasonably as possible;</li>
		    	<li>procedures to enable the prevention and detection of inaccuracies and fraud and the ability to reconstruct any lost records;</li>
		    	<li>identification of the duties of officers dealing with financial transactions and division of responsibilities of those officers in relation to significant transactions;</li>
		    	<li>procedures to ensure that uncollectable amounts, including any bad debts are not submitted to the Council for approval to be written off except with the approval of the RFO and that the approvals are shown in the accounting records; and</li>
		    	<li>measures to ensure that risk is properly managed.</li>
		    </ul>

		    	<li>approving accounting statements;</li>
		    	<li>approving an annual governance statement;</li>
		    	<li>borrowing;</li>
		    	<li>writing off bad debts;</li>
		    	<li>addressing recommendations in any report from the internal or external auditors, shall be a matter for the full Council only.</li>
		    </ul>
		<p>1.14. In addition, the Council must:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>determine and keep under regular review the bank mandate for all Council bank accounts;</li>
