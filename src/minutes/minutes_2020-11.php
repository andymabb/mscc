<p>4. 4.4.4.4.4.4.5xi) Cllr. Alun Davies gave details of the specification and costs of a notice board received from Centaframe. It was proposed by Cllr. J. Davies, seconded by Cllr.

<p>4.4.4.4.11i) It was agreed that the Clerk approach Biomass regarding the felling of the two ash trees infected with ash dieback at Caledfwlch.     			                    			         	           <em>Clerk</em></p>

<p>8. The Remembrance Service had been held on Sunday 8th November, due to Covid 19 this had involved a procession to, and brief ceremony at, the Cenotaph as the Church remained closed to the public. Cllr. Alun Davies was thanked for clearing around the Monument and the police for providing traffic management.</p>
<p>It was suggested that a tree overhanging the monument should be cut down as it was contributing to the build-up of moss and algae and general damp conditions not favourable to the preservation of the Monument. Cllr. J. Davies would ask the landowner for permission to fell the tree.</p>
<p>Discussions were held over the possibility of creating a footpath within the field between the Church and monument but this was not considered feasible. It was felt that the current arrangements for a service that was held once a year, with the police in attendance to monitor traffic, worked very well.</p>
<p>It was proposed by Cllr. Alun Davies, seconded by Cllr. W. Loynton and unanimously agreed that a £100 donation be made to the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal.						<em>Clerk</em></p>

<h4>7. PLANNING</h4>		
<p>Cllr. J. Davies declared an interest in Planning Application PL/00489 (role as County Councillor) and Cllr. A. Thomas in Planning Application PL/0590 (owner of adjacent land). They did not take part in the relevant discussions or decisions.</p>
<p>The following was unanimously agreed:</p>

<ul class="planning-applications">
<li>
	<dl>
		<dt>PL/00489</dt>	
		<dd>One Planet Development</dd>
		<dd>
			Land Between Caegroes and Cwmwern<br>
			Penybanc<br>
			Llandeilo
		</dd>
		<dd>
			<p>OBJECTIONS</p>
			<p>1. In its view the development is unsustainable; the only source of potential income actually tied to the land is the growing and sale of fresh produce. Other aspects of the business, namely the provision of music therapy sessions and hiking sessions do not require association with a parcel of land in the countryside.</p>
			<p>2. The development is outside the LDP and granting permission would be unfair and inequitable to other applications for dwellings that require the meeting of rigorous sustainability criteria prior to any application being granted as opposed to the requirement to prove sustainability for One Planet developments after permission has been granted.</p>
			<p>3. The various business elements proposed in this development would generate road traffic and footfall that pose safety concerns on the narrow country lane serving the property and spaces allocated for parking within the site are inadequate.</p>
			<p>4. The development would be visible from Dinefwr Park visited by tens of thousands of visitors each year.</p>
			<p>5. Question mark over water and electricity supplies on the site.</p>
			<p>6. Further and more detailed general observations on One Planet developments and also relevant to this specific application are included in the letter attached to this email.</p>

		</dd>
		<dd>
			<p>OBJECTIONS</p>
			<p>1. The development occupies a central and prominent location that is not in keeping with the existing character of the village; the proposed design is not empathetic to the architecture of the area.</p>
			<p>2. The pods are sited too close to existing dwellings.</p>
			<p>3. The capacity of the car park would be inadequate with the much increased demand generated by the new business potential. Customers would be forced to park their vehicles on the main road through the village and this could lead to safety and access issues on what is already a relatively narrow road.</p>
			<p>4. The access lane to the car park itself is very narrow and unsuitable for the traffic that will be generated by this development.</p>
